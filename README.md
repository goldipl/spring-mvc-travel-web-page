## Technologies
Project was created with:
* `Java 8`

If you want to run this app, you have to add to **WebContent** -> **WEB-INF** -> **lib** folder,  
Java Spring 5.2.3. Framework .JAR files or newer and two javax servlet .JARs i.e.:  
- **javax.servlet.jsp.jstl-1.2.1.jar**

That's all.
Of course you have to use Java EE IDE and server e.g. Tomcat
